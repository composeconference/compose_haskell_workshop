### ... and Sanity Checking


Ensure that you have the following programs installed and functioning correctly:

* GHC(i)

At a command prompt, enter the following command:


```shell
ghci
```

This should launch the GHC Haskell REPL.

Type the following to ensure that you have a functioning REPL:

~~~ {data-language="haskell"}
1 + 1
~~~

This should yield the result:

```text
2
```
