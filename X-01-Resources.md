Required Resources
==================

Before you begin you will require the following...

## A Text-Editor

We are assuming previous programming experience, however, if you would like a
recommendation, have a look at
[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/),
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), or the ever-popular
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/). Just make sure that you are fluent enough to embark
on exercises as they appear in the workshop.

## [The Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)

In order to run the programs written during this workshop you will need a Haskell
installation. The easiest way to get up and running is to install the latest
Haskell Platform. This is a "batteries included" installation of GHC and Cabal
that includes many of the most useful packages available in the Hackage ecosystem.



Useful Resources
================

These resources are available to help you with any issues you face when learning Haskell:

## \#haskell on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/)

An IRC channel dedicated to discussion of Haskell. This is often the easiest place to fire off
a one-off question that is simple enough not to warrant a permanent listing on the internet.

## [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html)

## [Hoogle](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/)

## [Hayoo](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html)

## [MFUG](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Functional-User-Group-MFUG/)

## [/r/haskell](www.reddit.com/r/haskell)
