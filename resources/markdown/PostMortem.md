# Post-Mortem { #post-mortem }

After running the workshop and having a few days to reflect, there are
many aspects that warrant analysis. Some things could have been run
more efficiently, or scrapped all-together. Certain administrative
processes could have been arranged in a manner that avoided some pitfalls.
There were also some non-conventional approaches adopted that worked
far better than anticipated, and these deserve some discussion.
Over-all, the workshop was a resounding success. The success stemmed
primarily from a drive to ensure that everyone attending was able to
extract tangible value from the workshop by the end of the day.

## Venue

* Water WTF
* Lifts
* Lunch - Vegans, etc.
* Wifi

## Admin

* Reddit fail
* Meetup
* Delegated responsibilities, but this requires planning

## People

* Regulating Numbers - Back-Pressure
* Categories helped - Admin | Volunteer | Contributor | Participant
* Soliciting Volunteers

## Consolidation

* Maintaining Centralised contacts list
* Have more concrete plans for post-workshop activities

## Failures

* Stratification?
* Missing connections between concepts
* External community outreach
* Cross-Platform Midi Players
* Cabal Constraints on Web-Site scaffold
* The "Domain Modelling" aspect was somewhat sidelined
* Not enough focus on types as language for communication
* Compilation errors in the IDE were hard to pinpoint
* Public speaking in a workshop context is very different
  to a lecture context. Why?

## Wins

* Fast-Pace with volunteers to provide hands-on assistance
* Open-Ended questions
* Easy-going approach
* Interactivity
* Material
* Project structure on GitHub facilitating collaboration
* Academic aspects were marginalised for the sake of practicality
* In response to stratification - On demand workflow
* Shotgun approach to concepts - Don't try to build a perfect
  in-order dependency graph. Introduce groups of concepts all
  at once, then provide hands-on-assistance with issues

## Future Workshop Ideas

* Intermediate workshop that aims to focus on just one project
* Spit into groups

## Bootstrapping a Dedicated Haskell Meetup

* Workshop is a good opportunity to bootstrap a dedicated meetup
