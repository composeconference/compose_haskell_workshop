Introduction
============

Welcome to the Melbourne Haskell Workshop 2013.

This intent of this workshop is to provide a working introduction to Haskell
for programmers in Melbourne who have not yet used the language in anger.

The workshop is split into "Chapters" - each lasting an hour. Chapters will start
with a few trivial introductory exercises to get your fingers warmed up,
then the meat - an exercise that should be able to be solved using the material
introduced up to that point, but with help and hints available if needed.

Each chapter will conclude with an open-question. This question should provide
inspiration for further consideration of how harder problems could
be solved using Haskell, and for more advanced atendees, can be attacked
instead of twiddeling your thumbs after finishing the main exercise.
